## Aim of the site

My client has stated they are unhappy with the knowledge gap when it comes to new and unexperienced Aquarim keepers.
My client has asked for a website that will educate and help to fill in the knowledge gap. 
They have asked for this to be designed and built to the follow specification;

A website to provide a step-by-step guide to educate, both newcomers and experience aquarium keepers alike.
The primary aim of the website is to provide the knowledge to help fill the knowledge gap and help the hobby to continue
successfully in the future.

The primary consumer of my clients website will be people who are new to the Aquarium keeping hobby and want to know how to set up their new tank.
As this is a niche market with very little competition the main requirement of the site is to increase knowledge and provide an online educational page for
the Aquarium keeping community.

As a business, they have provided me with the following goals for the site.

1. A simple but professional design.
2. A colour pallet to reflect the hobby.
3. A form to pass any questions the consumer may have to my client for him to answer in his own time.
4. Clear and interactive, allowing the user to learn.
