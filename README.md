# Sharing Aquatic Knowledge

---

## Aim of the site

My client has stated they are unhappy with the knowledge gap when it comes to new and unexperienced Aquarim keepers.
My client has asked for a website that will educate and help to fill in the knowledge gap. 
They have asked for this to be designed and built to the follow specification;

A website to provide a step-by-step guide to educate, both newcomers and experience aquarium keepers alike.
The primary aim of the website is to provide the knowledge to help fill the knowledge gap and help the hobby to continue
successfully in the future.

The primary consumer of my clients website will be people who are new to the Aquarium keeping hobby and want to know how to set up their new tank.
As this is a niche market with very little competition the main requirement of the site is to increase knowledge and provide an online educational page for
the Aquarium keeping community.

As a business, they have provided me with the following goals for the site.

1. A simple but professional design.
2. A colour pallet to reflect the hobby.
3. A form to pass any questions the consumer may have to my client for him to answer in his own time.
4. Clear and interactive, allowing the user to learn.

## UX

As the website is a completely new project and not a redesign, the building of a consumer base will be reliant on google result and obtained through word of mouth.
The main aim is to draw new consumers that meet the below criteria 

1. Are in the Aquarium keeping hobby or have an interest.
2. Have recently purchased a tank or planning on purchasing a tank.
3. Wish to educate themselves and expand their knowledge.

To help this site stand out from the other How-To-Guides and Aquarium keeping pages, it needs to ensure it

* Is easy to navigate and  to understand the structure of the site.
* Provides clear and consise information.
* Allows the user to ask questions and get a response from a seasoned Aquarium Keeper.

## User stories

"As a visitor to the site I want to be met with clear and consise information that allows me to both understand and learn what the website is telling me so that I can complete my set-up in an efficient and effective manner"

"As a visitor I want to ensure I feel confident that the information that the website is providing is correct and has come from a reliable source, to ensure that I am satisfied with the support at hand when completing my tank set-up"

"As a visitor I want to be able to easily find contact information so I can discuss any questions or problems that may occur in the process of setting up my tank"

## Wireframe Mockups:

During the design process sitting with the client we drew up wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). During the development, minor adjustments were made to allow the page to flow better for the user.

## Testing

My initial testing was carried out using Chromes developer tools to ensure that the site scaled correctly on each screen size.

I also used the below tools to help ensure no issues as I completed each page of my build.

- [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate HTML.

- [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS

---

### Issues and resolutions

During build the following issues were raised

- Couldn't make the header fully responsive

During my build I couldn't make the header fully responsive due to differnet column widths at break points, this was resolved by removing a column that was hidden on smaller screens and making it even columns throughout, 
allowing me to make it fully responsive.

- Navbar dropdown menu displaying behind hero image

This was resolved by adding a z index to bring the nabar dropdown to the front.

- Contact us modal allowing a blank form to be submitted 

Added required to the input tags to ensure information has to be inputted.

- Links for other pages displaying error 404 page not found when deployed

Used page address from github as href instead of relative file path

- Alignment issue

Sorted by removing the margin bootstrap adds to its rows
