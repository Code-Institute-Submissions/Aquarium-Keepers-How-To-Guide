## Aim of the site

My client has stated they are unhappy with the knowledge gap when it comes to new and unexperienced Aquarim keepers.
My client has asked for a website that will educate and help to fill in the knowledge gap. 
They have asked for this to be designed and built to the follow specification;

A website to provide a step-by-step guide to educate, both newcomers and experience aquarium keepers alike.
The primary aim of the website is to provide the knowledge to help fill the knowledge gap and help the hobby to continue
successfully in the future.

The primary consumer of my clients website will be people who are new to the Aquarium keeping hobby and want to know how to set up their new tank.
As this is a niche market with very little competition the main requirement of the site is to increase knowledge and provide an online educational page for
the Aquarium keeping community.

As a business, they have provided me with the following goals for the site.

1. A simple but professional design.
2. A colour pallet to reflect the hobby.
3. A form to pass any questions the consumer may have to my client for him to answer in his own time.
4. Clear and interactive, allowing the user to learn.

## UX

As the website is a completely new project and not a redesign, the building of a consumer base will be reliant on google result and obtained through word of mouth.
The main aim is to draw new consumers that meet the below criteria 

1. Are in the Aquarium keeping hobby or have an interest.
2. Have recently purchased a tank or planning on purchasing a tank.
3. Wish to educate themselves and expand their knowledge.

To help this site stand out from the other How-To-Guides and Aquarium keeping pages, it needs to ensure it

* Is easy to navigate and  to understand the structure of the site.
* Provides clear and consise information.
* Allows the user to ask questions and get a response from a seasoned Aquarium Keeper.

## Wireframe Mockups:

During the design process sitting with the client we drew up wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). During the development, minor adjustments were made to allow the page to flow better for the user.
