                <p>It all starts before you purchase your first tank... Once you know what space you have available for your new setup, do some research, find out what is on 
                 the market. Don't just buy the cheapest aquarium you can afford at the time. The more you can afford to spend, the better quality of aquarium you'll get and
                 the more enjoyment you'll get! (It's a marathon, not a sprint!). Research is one of the most important things in the aquarium keeping hobby. 
                 You should always do your research before you decide to do anything in this hobby, this helps to prevent yourself from getting in messy situations, 
                 whether it be with fish compatibility, prefered food types or even your equipment setup!</p>

            <div class="col-10 setup-text">
                <p>After you've purchased your first aquarium, you need to make sure that you have all the required equipment for a successful aquarium setup. Most ready to go tank
                setups that are available from most aquatic retailers should include the following : The tank (complete with lid), a heater suited to the size of the tank, a filter 
                suited to the size of the tank and an LED light. While the equiptment provided with the tank will be suited to the tank, they may not be suited to a high population
                of aquatic life in your tank. In our experience, it's best to upgrade the standard equipment that comes with the tank, but this can be done over time.</p>
                <p>While the majority of aquatic life will be content with the standard aquarium setup, some aquatic life requires specialised equipment to help replicate
                their natural habitat. There's also several accessories to help make your life as an aquarium keeper easier. 
                These may include but is not limited to: An airstone or aquastone, A powerhead, A thermometer, An auto-feeder and A gravel vacuum.</p>

                <h3 class="setup-subtitle">Installation</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-10 setup-text">
                <p>For the main part, the installation of the tank should be pretty straight forward. There should be an instruction manual with your setup that details how to setup the 
                standard equipment that has come with the tank. As for any additional accessories or equipment you've decided you want in your aquarium, read below in the accessories section 
                for details on how to set them up.</p>
                <p>To begin with, you want to position the tank where you want it. (They become very difficult to move once they have water in). Once in place, you'll want to fill the tank 
                approximately 3/4 with water. The filter and heater can now be installed, to do so, use the suction cups that come with both products and position them in your tank. Ideally, 
                you want the heater near the filter to help with the circulation of the heated water. We personally prefer to put both in one of the back corners out of the way. Now you can install
                the light, generally, they either attach to the lid of the tank or they sit across the support beams at the top of the tank. Once everything is installed, the tank can be topped up with
                water until its about 2-3" from the top. Everything can then be plugged in and switched on.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-10 setup-text">
                <p>In this section we'll cover some of the more well known accessories, there are more available. If you have any problems or difficulty setting up an accessory, feel free to 
                get in touch using the contact button at the bottom of the page and we can provide assistance.</p>
                <p>The airstone / aquastone</p>
                <p>Used to help oxygenate the aquarium, the airstone is recomended for any aquarium. To setup an airstone, you'll need an air pump. Start by attaching the airstone to the piping 
                provided with the air pump. Attach the other end of the piping to the air pump. submerge the air stone into the tank and position as you like at the bottom of your tank. The air 
                pump can then be plugged in and switched on.</p>
                <p>Thermometer</p>
                <p>Used to help regulate the temperature of the aquarium water, a thermometer is a must have in any aquarium setup. The simplest of thermometer come with a suction cup which can
                easily be attached to the glass of the tank with the scale reading outwards. For more sophisticated thermometers, you need to set the display up on the top of the tank and have the 
                temperature sensor in the tank through the cable holes at the back of the tank. These may be either battery powered or mains.</p>
                <p>Powerhead</p>
                <p>Also commonly known as a wave maker, the powerhead is used to help replicate the current of natural rivers or seas. They are generally used for more specialised fish that need 
                a fast flowing current or to help encourage fish breeding. To setup, submerge the powerhead into the tank and use the provided suction cup to attach the powerhead to the side of the 
                tank. You can then plug in the the powerhead and switch it on.</p>
